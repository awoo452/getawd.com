                            <h4>Jaaron's Services - My Latest Project!</h4>
                            <p>Over the last few months I have been working on a few projects, one of which: <a href="https://www.jaaronsservices.com">Jaaron's Landscaping</a>. This is a website I created to help market the landscaping company I started with a good friend of mine, Jared. After obtaining my real estate license and starting work with <a href="https://www.thepnwteam.com">The PNW Team</a>, I identified an unmet demand for landscaping services within this industry. As such, Jaaron's Services LLC was created, providing both commercial and residential landscaping solutions in the greater Puget Sound area.</p>
                            <p>My main focus with this project is to apply many of the skills I have obtained through my courses at WGU - providing bids and other customer interaction, bookkeeping, project management, utilizing technology such as google workspace, and audits of completed jobs to ensure profitability.</p>
                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>Over the next few months I intend to continue developing this buiness and adding to the website as I do so. I will also continue working toward obtaining my WGU degree, which I am on track to complete by the end of October!</p>

                            <h4>Obtained my Real Estate License!</h4>
                            <p>Earlier this year I sold my house in Tacoma with a local real estate agent, <a href="https://realty.thepnwteam.com/andre-bohall">Andre Bohall</a> at <a href="https://www.thepnwteam.com">The PNW Team Keller Williams</a>. I was impressed by the level of service provided in both my original purchase and the sale, as such I felt it would be a rewarding place to work. So I asked for a job, interviewed thrice, and am now working as an Executive Assistant to one of the top producing agents in the area!</p>
                            <p>As with any new job, this came with it's own set of challenges. I was asked to obtain my real estate license within 3 months, and after completing 90 clock hours of <a href="https://www.rockwellinstitute.com/">Rockwell</a> training I was able to meet this deadline. I am now a licensed real estate agent in the state of Washington, and am effectively managing 10 or more transactions at any time!</p>
                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>Over the next few months I plan to continue working towards the completion of my WGU degree. While doing so I will also continue to educate myself in the world of real estate, and hope to utilize the skills and abilities I am learning with WGU to help develop some standard processes and procedures related to each transaction utilizing <a href="https://www.brivity.com">Brivity</a> CRM.</p>

                            <h4>CEFAB - Off-Road Fabrication Website, Powered by AWS!</h4>
                            <p>Over the last month I have spent a ton of time on a new web development project, the <a href="https://www.cefab-offroad.com">CEFAB Off-Road</a> website. This is a personal project that I have created to showcase some of my ongoing off-road related fabrication projects! Check out the <a href="https://www.cefab-offroad.com/wjcherokee">WJ Cherokee</a> section, it's the first of many project pages to come!</p>
                            <p>I also spent some time learning the basics of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> with the help of the extensive documentation available. The end result is a static website hosted through AWS Amplify, with SSL, that is connected to my GitHub repository, and updates automatically every time I push a new update to the repo. In short, I have found that AWS provides a more efficient way to host a website, with extensive and accurate documentation to help you get it hosted, and is a much more affordable alternative over traditional hosting services!</p>
                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>Over the next month I intend to spend more time learning the AWS platform, as I have only scratched the surface with this project over the last month. I plan to learn more about APIs and will use them to incorporate some new and more interactive features into all of the websites I have created!</p>

                            <p>Over the last month I have been learning to use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="blank">Sass</a>, which I can already tell is going to be a critical element of organization for web development. With so many emerging web browsers and screen resolutions, design can be quite intimidating! However, Sass addresses many cross-browser compatibility issues automatically, which is just one of many huge benefits it provides. The use of variables has also allowed me to completely restructure this website on the back end, providing a more organized and scalable platform moving forward.</p>
                            <p>Earlier in the month, I built a <a href="https://master.d2inu3bsl9o649.amplifyapp.com/" target="blank">Gameboy</a> as a tribute to one of my favorite pieces of technology as a child. Click the power button for a little Nintendo nostalgia! I am starting to apply some of the programming concepts I have been studying in a web design environment, and it has truly been an intriguing experience!</p>
                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>I also spent time developing the <a href="http://www.getawd.com/#about">About</a> section, which provides more information about my employment history, professional experience, and my goals moving forward. Follow the link to check it out! Over the next month I will continue to learn JavaScript, Sass, and jQuery as I develop this website and others while learning more about responsive web development!</p>

                            <h4>BlackJack - My first tutorial free project is live!</h4>
                            <p>I have been working through a few of the many available online resources to learn some of the basics of programming, most notably freeCodeCamp, codewars, and codecademy pro. These three tools have proven essential as I began my coding journey.</p>
                            <p>I am proud to announce that my very first project I have ever created using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS is live. It is a basic blackjack game, and every part of this game was created without the help of any online tutorials. I have always believed the best way to learn something is to just start doing it, and programming is proving to be no exception!</p>
                            <p>The game is pretty basic for now, but it is completely functional and it really helped me understand some of the practial uses of JavaScript classes, function parameters, if / else statements, and for loops. It also gave me a greater understanding of the DOM and how to manipulate objects within it, and I am quickly realizing how powerful of a tool that can be.</p>
                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>My primary focus at this time - learning the basics of JavaScript in a web development environment. Moving forward, I will continue to develop simple applications as I learn more about basic JavaScript, and once I have a greater understanding of Vanilla JS, I will move to frameworks - which I am definitely excited to learn how to use!</p>
