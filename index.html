                        <p>My name is Aaron, and I reside in Washington state. I have recently graduated from Western Governors University with a degree in Business Administration - IT Management. I am continuing to supplement this education with a variety of web based programming certifications such as freeCodeCamp and Codecademy, alongside the use of web programming in a real world setting, through the creation of programs, applications, and websites.</p>

                        <p>Currently, I'm employed full time with <a href="https://www.moxiworks.com">MoxiWorks</a>, where we provide real estate brokerages with IT related services including websites, email management, CRM, marketing, and other software platforms to assist with business development. Moxi provides these services for many real estate brokerages all around North America, and I am currently working with several of these brokerages to support their agents with initial setup, usage questions, and troubleshooting steps / escalation as necessary. I utilize platforms such as Microsoft Exchange, Atlassian, and Zendesk daily to complete these tasks, and I am absolutely loving every minute of it!</p>

                        <p>Recently, as a licensed real estate agent at <a href="https://www.thepnwteam.com/">The PNW Team Keller Williams</a>, I worked as an executive assistant for one of the top producing agents in the area. My responsibilities included managing all aspects of 10 or more real estate transactions from start to finish while ensuring each of our clients had the best experience possible. I also managed our database using Brivity CRM to ensure all pertinent information related to each transaction was documented and updated.</p>

                        <p>Before that at <a href="http://www.nitehawksweepers.com">Nitehawk Sweepers</a>, I worked as the parts and service manager. While I was in this role the company exceeded budget in total parts sales, and also saw an increase in profit margins. Before that, I managed a team of installers and fabricators, where we produced a record number of units in both 2017 and 2018! As the production manager I also oversaw the transition of the production floor from a "job-shop" to an assembly line with an emphasis on lean manufacturing principles. This resulted in an increase in production efficency, improved inventory tracking, and a much safer work environment for all employees.</p>
